    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lightly seasoned chicken meatballs are threaded onto skewers, grilled, and finished with a sweet, savory sauce.</p>
    <p>These easy Mediterranean Chicken Meatballs are the best chicken meatballs I've ever made! With just a few simple ingredients, they come out super flavorful, moist, and absolutely perfect in just 30 minutes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain fine bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Â¼4 skewers</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add chicken, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, salt, pepper, cayenne, green onions, garlic, and bread crumbs to a bowl, and use a fork to gently but thoroughly mix everything together. Wrap and chill in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes before shaping.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, and lightly grease the foil.</li>
        <li>Divide meatball mixture into 16 portions (about 2 rounded tablespoons each), and transfer onto the prepared pan. Using damp hands, roll each portion into a smooth meatball; and space out evenly on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Meatballs will be just cooked through, and an instant read thermometer inserted near the center will read 145 to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Let cool; wrap and keep in the refrigerator until needed. These can be made the day before.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill, preferably charcoal, for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir ketchup, hoisin, fresh ginger, and rice vinegar together in a small bowl, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place 4 meatballs on each skewer, and grill until lightly charred and heated through, about 3 minutes per side. Turn over, and brush with glaze. Turn back over, so the brushed side is down, and let sear for about 30 seconds; meanwhile, brush top with glaze.</li>
        <li>Turn over once more and let sear for about 30 seconds; remove from the heat. Apply more glaze after removing from the grill, as desired. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
